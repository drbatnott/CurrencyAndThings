Introducing some formatting and File writing
We are beginning to learn about
Data types and how to format the number of decimal places used when we write them
How to do IO - write to a file (and eventually read)
How we can loop through container classes - we used a List<string> and a List<float> and did a foreach
we showed how we could do a for next loop as well
